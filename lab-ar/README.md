Lab 2: AR 9/30/19
A potential app idea for AR could have the user use track a RC car around a track. The track will be accessible by geo location.
Different areas would have different courses that the user would have to track an RC car through the track. For example, the
user would go to a fountain where a circle track is layed around the fountain. The user would then point their device to the area
and track the RC car from start to finish of the track to complete the course.
